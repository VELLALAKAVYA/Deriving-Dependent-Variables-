Dependent Variables
  - Independent variables are the input for a process that is being analyzes and can be manipulated or changed and whose effects are           measured and compared </br>
  - The independent variables are called as such because independent variables predict or forecast the values of the dependent variable in     the model </br>
  - Dependent variables are the output of the process </br>
  - The dependent variables refer to that type of variable that measures the affect of the independent variable(s) on the test units </br>
  - The other name for the dependent variable is the Predicted variable(s) 
  </br>
  - Independent variables are also called “regressors,“ “controlled variable,” “manipulated variable,” “explanatory variable,” “exposure       variable,” and/or “input variable </br>
  - Similarly, dependent variables are also called “response variable,” “regressand,” “measured variable,” “observed variable,”               “responding variable,” “explained variable,” “outcome variable,” “experimental variable,” and/or “output variable </br>
  
 # Dependent Variable Definition
 The dependent variable(DV) is just like the name sounds; it depends upon some factor that you, the researcher, controls. </br>
 For example: </br>
  - How well you perform in a race depends on your training.</br>
  - How much you weigh depends on your diet. </br>
  - How much you earn depends upon the number of hours you work. </br>
  
 # Dependent Variable in Statistical Modeling
 The DV represents the model’s output or outcome that you are studying. It is usually given the letter “y” and is traditionally graphed on   the y-axis. The IV represents the potential causes for variation in the model. </br>
 It is usually given the letter “x” and is graphed on the   x-axis
